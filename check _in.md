# Capstone check-in 3

## Requirements

1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?
2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?
3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
6. What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you _have_ to get done versus what would you _like_ to get done?
7. What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?


### Exec Sum (need to add more)
Building a sports gambling model.

The betting model I have developed is going to attempt to assess the current potential of a team, which is then compared to its opposition in an attempt to gauge the likely outcome of the contest. This will be accomplished by building a classification model with all the NFL teams, odds, spreads, and outcomes since the 2014 to the 2018 season. This model will then help provide insights to sports bettors on whether teams are more likely to go over or under the set betting line. In order to make this classification model I will creatively handle missing data and null values.

###  Problem Statement
Is it possible to find value in the NFL betting markets and provide insights to bettors to beat the sports handicappers? 


### 1
Yes, I do have all my data in hand however I am looking at attaining more data related to players on each team but not sure how I would incorporate it yet. With limited amount of time trying to assign every player to their respective teams could be quite difficult. Have thought about looking into this after the fact and incorporating later on when I have more time.
### 2
Yes, I have done a majority of my eda however I am looking into creating some additional columns based of the data and dummy variables as well. I also need to look into more visualizations but have been really focused on how the best way to handle null values.
### 3
I have not begun the modeling process yet. Need to work on feature engineering and preparing my features for modeling.
### 4
My biggest blockers are figuring out how to handle some of the missing data. I have been looking into matt brems lecture on missing data and seeing about finding a different solution then I have right now. Which is taking the median or mode depending on which I think will work best. However, I think there could be a better solution.

### 5
I changed my capstone to my second topic I talked about it, which was a sports gambling model because was not able to aquire the enough quality and succifient data to do my first topic on non-profits

### 6
My timeline for this week and next week is making sure my data cleaning and EDA make sense for my modeling, then preforming my model testing and looking at what could be tuned within my model. Next will be looking into model predictions and seeing what insights I can pull from it. Finally will be working on the technical report to wrap up the project
### 7
How to make my capstone a bit more complex. Struggling with I think it may be to generic and not as complex as I would like but not sure exactly what I can do to increase the complexity. Also what is the best way to deal with null values.
