# Predicting Over/Under Outcomes for NFL Games

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sports gambling has become very popular in todayâ€™s society, even more so with the legalization of sports gambling in  a few states. There are now dedicated TV, radio, and podcasts dedicated to betting on sports. Sports bettors are trying to do everything they can to beat the odds makers. With the surplus of data available, being able to find trends and any statistical advantage can make all the difference when placing a bet. This betting model developed is going to attempt to assess the current potential of a NFL team, which is then compared to its opposition in an attempt to gauge the likely outcome of the contest. This will be accomplished by building a classification model with all the NFL teams, odds, spreads, and outcomes since the 2014 to the 2018 season. This model will then help provide insights to sports bettors on whether teams are more likely to go over or under the set betting line. In order to make this classification model we will creatively handle missing data and null values and see what factors make the biggest difference when predicting the outcome of a NFL game.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Is it possible to find value in the NFL betting markets and provide insights to bettors to beat the sports handicappers?
